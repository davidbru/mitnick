# Kevin Mitnick - Ghost in the Wire
Paperback Version

Trying to solve all of the 38 ciphers. Currently I was able to decipher the first 35 ciphers.

Since the different book editions (e.g. Paperback, Hardcover,...) seem to also feature different ciphers, that is not always an easy task.

Possible clues can be found here:

Since I'm stuck on the last 3 ciphers I welcome every kind of help. 

Basically I need help for the files 36, 37 and 38.

Ideally it should be a standalone php-script like the first 35 files.
